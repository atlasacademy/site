<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This privacy policy was mandated by the Google OAuth Verification process.</p>
<h3>What information do you collect?</h3>
<p>
    We run Google Analytics in our web apps to track usage. Google Analytics tracks browser, operating system, and session time.
    We do not have any server logs (as the servers are hosted by Github and not us).
    Google Sheets does have some history on usage if your OAuth was used to make changes to our submission sheet but these history are anonymous.
    And finally, the Drop Serializer application of course is made for the purpose of crowd sourcing drop data for FGO. If you export drop rates to us, we will be storing that data on the sheet.
    Exported data includes the drop rate and whatever alias you wish to be identified as.
</p>
<h3>How do you use the information?</h3>
<p>
    We use Google Analytics to track how actively a project is being used to gauge it's popularity and effectiveness.
    Drop data we keep to calculate drop rates in FGO.
</p>
<h3>What information do you share?</h3>
<p>
    We do not share any client information regarding who and how often an app is being used.
    All drop rates are made public and free to use for all.
